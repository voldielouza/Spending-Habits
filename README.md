# Spending-Habits
## Project Overview
This project investigates the leisure spending habits of individuals, analyzing how various factors such as age, gender, and monthly income influence their spending patterns. The objective is to understand demographic trends in leisure spending and examine whether traditional economic theories align with these trends.

Our hypothesis is that age, gender, employment status, and monthly income do not significantly influence leisure spending. We aim to identify the variables that shape these spending habits and provide insights into spending behavior across different demographics.

## Final Report
For a detailed explanation of our analysis, methods, and results, please refer to the [Final Report](./Spending-Habits-Report.pdf).

## Key Learnings
Throughout the course of this project, we gained experience in:
- **Data Collection**: Conducting surveys through Google Forms to get responses.
- **Data Cleaning & Management**: Combining responses from multiple team members into a single, clean dataset using Excel/Google Sheets for further analysis.
- **Regression Analysis**: Performing regression analysis in SAS to examine the relationships between various predictors (age, gender, spending type, monthly income) and leisure spending as the response variable.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Using statistical methods to test whether predictors have a significant influence on leisure spending.
- **Model Refinement**: Identifying key predictors and interactions through hypothesis testing and refining the regression model by dropping or retaining relevant variables.

### Insights Gained:
- The significance of choosing appropriate predictors in regression models.
- Interpreting interactions between multiple variables.
- How to find meaningful insights from statistical analysis to understand demographic spending behaviors.

## Technologies Used
- **Google Forms**: Used for data collection via surveys, gathering responses on demographics and leisure spending habits.
- **Excel/Google Sheets**: Utilized for cleaning and stacking data, combining responses from all team members into one dataset.
- **SAS**: Employed for data analysis, including performing regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and model refinement.
